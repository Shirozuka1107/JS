To do this, use a .querySelector to locate the input field and then use the .value property to get the number entered.
Store this in a value variable.
const value = document.querySelector('numbers').value; 

The .split() method takes a string and splits it into an array of strings. You can pass it a string of characters or a RegEx to use as a separator. 
const array = value.split(/,\s*/g); 

Remember that .map() creates a new array, instead of mutating the original array.
const numbers = array.map();

Add a callback function to your .map() method that converts each element to a number.
const numbers = array.map(el => Number(el));

The .filter() method will allow you to filter elements out of an array, creating a new array in the process.
const filtered = numbers.filter();

The callback function needs to return a Boolean value, which indicates whether the element should be included in the new array. In this case, you want to return true if the element is not NaN (not a number).
const filtered = numbers.filter(el => 
!isNaN(el));

The .reduce() method takes an array and applies a callback function to condense the array into a single value.
const sum = array.reduce();

The first is the accumulator, and the second is the current element in the array. The return value for the callback becomes the value of the accumulator on the next iteration.
const sum = array.reduce((acc,el) => acc + el);

The next step in calculating the mean is to divide the sum of numbers by the count of numbers in the list.
const mean = sum / array.length;

Using the implicit return of an arrow function, you can directly return the value of the .reduce() method divided by the length of the array, without having to assign any variables.
array.reduce((acc, el) => acc + el, 0) / array.length; 

To display the value of mean, your app has a #mean element ready to go.
Use a .querySelector to find that element, and then set its .textContent to the value of mean.
document.querySelector("#mean").textContent = mean;

The first step in calculating the median is to ensure the list of numbers is sorted from least to greatest. Once again, there is an array method ideal for this â€“ the .sort() method.
const sorted = array.sort();

To sort your numbers from smallest to largest, pass a callback function that takes parameters a and b, and returns the result of subtracting b from a.
const sorted = array.sort((a,b) => {a-b})

Create a variable called isEven. Then use the modulus operator to check if the length of the testArr2 array is even. Assign that expression to the isEven variable.
const testArr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const testArr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const isEven = testArr2.length % 2 === 0;
console.log(isEven);

Here is how to find the middle number of an array with an odd number of elements:
Example Code
arr[Math.floor(arr.length / 2)];

Declare an oddListMedian variable and assign it the result of finding the middle number of the testArr1. Then log the oddListMedian variable to the console.
const oddListMedian = testArr1[Math.floor(testArr1.length /2)];
console.log(oddListMedian);

// first middle number
arr[arr.length / 2];
// second middle number
arr[(arr.length / 2) - 1];
Create an evenListMedian variable and assign it the result of finding the median of the testArr2.
const firstMiddleNumber = testArr2[testArr2.length / 2];
const secondMiddleNumber = testArr2[(testArr2.length / 2) - 1];
const evenListMedian = getMean([firstMiddleNumber, secondMiddleNumber])
console.log(evenListMedian);

//Important//
Inside your getMedian function, check if the length of sorted is even. If it is, find the middle two numbers, calculate their mean, and return the result. If the length of sorted is odd, return the middle number.
   const median = 
   sorted.length % 2 === 0 ? getMean([sorted[sorted.length / 2 - 1], sorted[sorted.length / 2]]) : sorted[Math.floor(sorted.length / 2)];
   return median

//Mode Function Code//
Inside the array.forEach() callback function, check if the current element is inside the counts object. If the element can be found, increment the value of counts[el] by 1. Otherwise, assign the number 1 to counts[el].
const getMode = (array) => {
  const counts = {};
  array.forEach(el => {
if (counts[el]) {
  counts[el] += 1;
} else {
  counts[el] = 1;
}
  })
  return counts;

//Simplified method//
Convert the forEach callback to use an expression body and replace the statements with a ternary.
const getMode = (array) => {
  const counts = {};
array.forEach(el => counts[el] = counts[el] ? counts[el] + 1 : 1)
  return counts;
