Below the team property, add four property key-value pairs.

A key named sport and a string value of "Football".
A key named year and a number value of 1986.
A key named isWorldCupWinner and a boolean value set to true.
A new key called headCoach with a value of an empty object.

const myFavoriteFootballTeam = {
  team: "Argentina",
  sport: "Football",
  year: 1986,
  isWorldCupWinner: true,
  headCoach: {},

};

The next step is to access the key called sport from the myFavoriteFootballTeam object and assign it to a new const variable called sport.

Remember you can use dot notation for this.
const sport = myFavoriteFootballTeam.sport;

The next step is to create a new array that will be responsible for adding the player card information to the page.

Inside the setPlayerCards function, start by adding the map method to arr that will take in an empty callback function. Then, use the addition assignment += operator to assign the new array to playerCards.innerHTML.

Remember that the innerHTML property gets, or in this case, sets the HTML markup for the playerCards element.
playerCards.innerHTML += arr.map(() => {});
