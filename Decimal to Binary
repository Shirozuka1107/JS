Your Convert button should be working now. But it could get tiring for users to enter in a number, then click that button each time they want to convert from decimal to binary. It would be much more convenient to perform the conversion when the Enter or Return key is pressed.

The keydown event fires every time a user presses a key on their keyboard, and is a good way to add more interactivity to input elements.

Chain .addEventListener() to numberInput. The event listener should listen for keydown events and take an empty arrow function as a callback.
numberInput.addEventListener("keydown", () => {});
